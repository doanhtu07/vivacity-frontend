## Env File

Normally, you would want to gitignore the .env.local and .next-env.d.ts file. But for the sake of testing, I'll leave these files right in the repo.

## Setup

To have the greatest experience, you should have my `backend` running `yarn dev` already to support API calls.

## Run

1. Run `yarn install`.

2. Run `yarn dev`.

## Requirements Check

- [x] Create a professional user interface in TypeScript using React

- [x] Allow the user to click on a picture of you and then have it call the API endpoint and display the information from the API on the page.

- [x] Store this code in GitHub and add nathanbirch as a collaborator

## Stretch Challenges Check

- [x] Add additional content to the webpage(s) to make the application look good

- [x] Allow the user to edit the data content coming from the API (only if you created a PostgreSQL database)

- [ ] Write unit tests in Jest to test your code

- [ ] Use the Redux Toolkit to store the API data
